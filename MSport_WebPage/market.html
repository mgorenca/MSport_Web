<th>E46 M3<br>(2001-2006)<br>m3 chassis</th>
<td>333 HP<br>269 lb-ft of torque<br>S54: 3.2L inline-six<br><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/bmw/e46-m3/">Market Data via Bringatrailer</a></td>
<td>It's the last naturally aspirated inline-six m3; which is why many consider it to be the last and the true m3. It has an almost perfect 50-50 weight distribution, 103.4 HP per litre, and a LSD. This car was EXTREMELY impressive for it's time, and still is impressive, but the only downside to this car is that they're getting pretty expensive for their age, and they happen to have a couple common problems that can cause catastrophic engine failure, and fixing them can be really really expensive.</td>

<th>E92 M3<br>(2007-2013)<br>m3 chassis</th>
<td>414 HP<br>295 lb-ft of torque<br>S65: 4.0L V8<br><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/bmw/e90-e92-m3/">Market Data via Bringatrailer</a>
</td>
<td>The first and the last m3 with a v8, the last m3 coupe, the last naturally aspirated m car. When this car came out, many were disappointed by BMW's decision to replace the inline-6 with a v8, but today those same disappointed individuals will claim they never said anything as such, and a lot of people don't know this, but this M3's v8 was actually lighter than it's predecessor's inline-six. This car was inspired by Formula Racing, and is actually a revised, smaller, and lighter version of the S85 in the E60 M5. It was the first time BMW offered the M3 with a carbon fiber roof from factory, and it's actually the last M3 to be offered in a coupe, which was what the M3 has always been, but now BMW calls the coupe M3; the M4, confusing I know. The only downsides to this car are; that like it's predecessor, it has problems that can turn it into a really nice and expensive paperweight(but it's actually the most reliable m3), it can feel slow in low-RPM's due to low torque figures, and it GUZZLES gas, so be ready to be besties with your gas-station clerk. Little FYI this one won the International Engine Of The Year 5 years in a row out of it's 6 years in production.</td>

<th>E82 1m<br>(Only in 2011)</th>
<td>335 HP<br>332 lb-ft of torque<br>N54: twin-turbo 3.0L inline-six<br><a href="https://bringatrailer.com/bmw/1m/">Market Data via Bringatrailer</a></td>
<td>Some say it's the true successor to the e46 m3, some say it's the modern day 2002, and some say it doesn't even have it's own m designated engine or even have one at all. This car was actually and parts bin project from some engineers at BMW's Motorsport department, and it was actually kept a secret until they were able to build most of it in order to present it to the head honchos at BMW. Both the body and chassis came from a 135i, but all of the suspension and differential came from the e92 m3. Although the 1m doesn't have an m motor, everything else feel like it's an m car, and actually the twin-turbo inline-six it has is really good and it's actually the inspiration for the S55 that's in the f80 and f82 m3/m4. This car IS special, and with the production of it being so low, it's one of the most in-demand BMWs, but production aside; a lot of people call this the most fun to drive cars, but you can find a similar package in the 135i, m2, and m2 comp, but it's just that this one is so iconic and truly a unicorn. The downsides are that the N54 motor from the 135i is known to be at the repair shop pretty often, only offered in a manual coupe with black interior, and only 3 exterior colors, the only other downside is that because they're so rare, they're expensive if you can find one,</td>
